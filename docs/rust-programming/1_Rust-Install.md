# Rust Install
## Install C++
1. Download microsoft C++ build tools from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
2. Double click to run it and follow the default procedure(make sure ```windows 10 sdk``` and ```english language pack``` is chosen).


**Why does Rust-installation need installing C++ firstly?**```This is a question that I will update when I get a deeper understanding of Rust.```

In a sentence of my current understanding, Rust supports functions offered by OS, which is provided through C++ libraries.

Also, the RustUP-init program has updated the ```path``` in os environment.

- ```.cargo```ï¼šit has two folders, ```bin``` and ```registry```
    - ```bin```: it stores a bunch of executable files which will be used when programming, such as create\build\run...
