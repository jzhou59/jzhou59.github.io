# XML
Intend to note down some basis in xml.

## Format of XML
```xml
<label>
    <sub-label>
    </sub-label>
</label>
```
label could be any words.

## xmlns
It is the abbreviation for xml namespace, using in 'xml' files which labels obeying certain pattern rather than any words.
If a xml file is given a xmlns, labels name should exists in that xmlns.

## xsi
It is the abbreviation for xml schema instance. In this case, a xml file could be parsed by programming languages to an Object.

## xsi:schemaLocation
It is a key-value pair specifing the value of xmlns(as the key).

## xsd
It is the file format of the value of xmlns(as the key).

## dtd
I would say it is another file format like xsd.
